# 03-Branching-plot-novel

Choose your adventure! This is the third programming assignment for ILS-Z399. For this assignment I created a branching plot novel where you decide the fate of a prisoner during a security breach in a gulag.
I use conditionals to facilitate flow through the story. The story is stored in a dictionary.
